# PG-PROJECT-The system begins with a USB camera strategically installed 
on the field to continuously monitor the surroundings and capture live video feeds. These feeds are processed on a laptop using a powerful object detection algorithm YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) which is capable of accurately identifying and classifying multiple types of intrusions, such as animals (e.g., wild boars, monkeys, cows), birds, or unauthorized human activity, based on their shape, size, and movement. 
Once an intruder is detected and classified, the information is passed to the ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the central control unit. The ESP32 then activates an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the real-time distance between the intruder and the protected crop zone. Based on this distance and an estimated average movement speed, the system predicts the time it would take for the intruder to reach the crops. If the calculated time indicates an immediate threat, the ESP32 activates deterrent mechanisms such as a buzzer and waterspray motor via a 2-channel relay module to safely scare the intruder.These include a buzzer, which emits a loud sound to scare off the intruder, and a water spray motor, which creates a physical, yet harmless, deterrent by spraying water in the direction of the movement.
In parallel, the system utilizes a GSM module to send an SMS alert to the farmer. The alert message contains critical information such as the type of intruder detected, estimated distance, and approximate time of arrival at the crop zone. This ensures that the farmer is kept informed in real time and can take further manual action if needed.
